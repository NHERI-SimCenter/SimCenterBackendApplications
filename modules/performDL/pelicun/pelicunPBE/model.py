    Describes the relationship between asset response and damage.

    Asset response is characterized by a Demand value that represents an
    engineering demand parameter (EDP). Only a scalar EDP is supported
    currently. The damage is characterized by a set of DamageStateGroup (DSG)
    objects. For each DSG, the corresponding EDP limit (i.e. the EDP at which
    the asset is assumed to experience damage described by the DSG) is
    considered uncertain; hence, it is described by a random variable. The
    random variables that describe EDP limits for the set of DSGs are not
    independent.

    We assume that the EDP limit will be approximated by a normal or lognormal
    distribution for each DSG and these variables together form a multivariate
    normal distribution. Following common practice, the correlation between
    variables is assumed perfect by default, but the framework allows the
    users to explore other, more realistic options.

    Parameters
    ----------
    EDP_limit: RandomVariableSubset
        A multidimensional random variable that might be defined as a subset
        of a bigger correlated group of variables or a complete set of
        variables created only for this Fragility Function (FF). The number of
        dimensions shall be equal to the number of DSGs handled by the
        FF.

        Given an EDP, get a damage level based on the fragility function.

    ----------
    ID: int
    DS_set: DamageState array
    DS_set_kind: {'single', 'mutually_exclusive', 'simultaneous'}

        When multiple DS are present, the 'mutually_exclusive' option assumes

class PerformanceGroup(object):

    A group of similar components that experience the same demands.

    FEMA P-58: Performance Groups (PGs) are a sub-categorization of fragility
    groups. A performance group is a subset of fragility group components that
    are subjected to the same demands (e.g. story drift, floor acceleration,
    etc.).

    In buildings, most performance groups shall be organized by story level.
    There is no need to separate performance groups by direction, because the
    direction of components within a group can be specified during definition,
    and it will be taken into consideration in the analysis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ID: int
    location: int
        Identifies the location of the components that belong to the PG. In a
        building, location shall typically refer to the story of the building.
        The location assigned to each PG shall be in agreement with the
        locations assigned to the Demand objects.
    quantity: RandomVariableSubset
        Specifies the quantity of components that belong to this PG.
        Uncertainty in component quantities is considered by assigning a
        random variable to this property.
    fragility_functions: FragilityFunction list
        Each fragility function describes the probability that the damage in
        a subset of components will meet or exceed the damages described by
        each damage state group in the DSG_set. Each is a multi-dimensional
        function if there is more than one DSG. The number of functions shall
        match the number of subsets defined by the `csg_weights` parameter.
    DSG_set: DamageStateGroup array
        A set of sequential Damage State Groups that describe the plausible set
        of damage states of the components in the FG.
    csg_weights: float ndarray, optional, default: [1.0]
        Identifies subgroups of components within a PG, each of which have
        perfectly correlated behavior. Correlation between the damage and
        consequences among subgroups is controlled by the `correlation`
        parameter of the FragilityGroup that the PG belongs to. Note that if
        the components are assumed to have perfectly correlated behavior at the
        PG level, assigning several subgroups to the PG is unnecessary. This
        input shall be a list of weights that are applied to the quantity
        of components to define the amount of components in each subgroup. The
        sum of assigned weights shall be 1.0.
    directions: int ndarray, optional, default: [0]
        Identifies the direction of each subgroup of components within the PG.
        The number of directions shall be identical to the number of
        csg_weights assigned. In buildings, directions typically correspond to
        the orientation of components in plane. Hence, using 0 or 1 to identify
        'X' or 'Y' is recommended. These directions shall be in agreement with
        the directions assigned to Demand objects.

    Characterizes a set of structural or non-structural components that have

    potential consequences resulting from their damage.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ID: int
    demand_type: {'PID', 'PFA', 'PSD', 'PSA', 'ePGA', 'PGD'}
        The type of Engineering Demand Parameter (EDP) that controls the damage
        of the components in the FG. See Demand for acronym descriptions.
    performance_groups: PerformanceGroup array
        A list of performance groups that contain the components characterized
        by the FG.
    directional: bool, optional, default: True
        Determines whether the components in the FG are sensitive to the
        directionality of the EDP.
    correlation: bool, optional, default: True
        Determines whether the components within a Performance Group (PG) will
        have correlated or uncorrelated damage. Correlated damage means that
        all components will have the same damage state. In the uncorrelated
        case, each component in the performance group will have its damage
        state evaluated independently. Correlated damage reduces the required
        computational effort for the calculation. Incorrect correlation
        modeling will only slightly affect the mean estimates, but might
        significantly change the dispersion of results.
    demand_location_offset: int, optional, default: 0
        Indicates if the location for the demand shall be different from the
        location of the components. Damage to components of the ceiling, for
        example, is controlled by demands on the floor above the one that the
        components belong to. This can be indicated by setting the
        demand_location_offset to 1 for such an FG.
    incomplete: bool, optional, default: False
        Indicates that the FG information is not complete and corresponding
        results shall be treated with caution.
    name: str, optional, default: ''

    description: str, optional, default: ''
