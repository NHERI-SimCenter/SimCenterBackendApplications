Version 2022-01:
* Adaptation to the modification in the ERACond class for the definition of
the parameter/moment functions.
First Release, 2021-03
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
This software generates joint distribution objects. The joint distribution
is defined by the connection of different marginal and conditional
distributions through the framework of a Bayesian network. 
While the marginal distributions are defined by ERADist classes, the
conditional distribution are defined by ERACond classes(see respective
classes).
The ERARosen class allows to carry out the transformation from physical
space X to standard normal space U (X2U) and vice versa (U2X) according
to the Rosenblatt transformation.
The other methods allow the computation of the joint PDF, the generation of
multivariate random samples and the plot of the Bayesian network which
defines the dependency between the different marginal and conditional
distributions.

    """
    Generation of joint distribution objects. 
    Construction of the joint distribution object with
    
    Obj = ERARosen(dist,depend,opt)
    
    'dist' must be a list or array which contains all the
    marginal distributions (ERADist objects) and conditional distributions
    (ERACond objects) that define the joint distribution.
    
    'depend' describes the dependency between the different marginal and
    conditional distributions. The dependency is defined by a list of arrays 
    which contain the indices of the parents of the respective distributions.
    The arrays within the list must be ordered according to the place of the 
    corresponding distribution in the input 'dist'. If a distribution is
    defined as a marginal, and therefore has no parents, an empty array([])
    must be given for that distribution in 'depend'. For conditional 
    distributions the order of the indices within one of the arrays
    corresponds to the order of the variables of the respective function
    handle of the respective ERACond object.
